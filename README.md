### Company History
A.A.N. Japan is a Japanese company specializing in automotive recycling and export since 2013. Our story mirrors the evolution of the entire industry — from the early stages of Japan’s recycling system to global recognition.  

- **2000–2005** – The foundation of the industry. Japan introduced the Automobile Recycling Act with mandatory standards for airbags, refrigerants, and batteries.  
- **2006–2010** – Standards and licensed yards emerged. The future founders arrived in Japan, gained experience in used tire trading, and discovered the growing auto dismantling sector.  
- **2013** – Establishment of A.A.N. Japan in Yachimata, Chiba. First milestones included securing a dismantling license and opening the initial yard.  
- **2015** – Relocation to Yotsukaidō, Chiba — one of Japan’s key hubs for auto dismantling, strategically close to Tokyo, Yokohama, and Narita Airport.  
- **2015–2020** – Growth period. Export of spare parts boomed. Expanded from 2 to 50+ employees, invested in machinery and facilities, introduced a Morita hydraulic press for scrap processing.  
- **2020–2023** – Pandemic and global instability challenged the industry. Despite this, A.A.N. Japan received multiple awards and recognitions from national associations and government authorities.  
- **Future** – Focus on digital transformation (ERP, Big Data, AI, Smart Yard), ESG initiatives (EV and battery recycling, green logistics), and globalization through new partnerships.

## History of Development

- **1950s** – No structured used car market; cars driven until scrap.  
- **Late 1950s** – Trade-ins appear; dealers resell via brokers.  
- **1967** – Toyota Usec launches first used car auction, replacing brokers with dealer-to-dealer trade.  
- **1970s** – JU unifies industry rules.  
- **1980s** – USS and corporate groups establish auctions as independent business.  
- **1990s** – Remote bidding (AUCNET, ASNET) enables nationwide participation.  
- **Today** – 130+ auction sites across Japan.  

---

## Auction Systems

- **Groups:** USS, TAA, ARAI, CAA, HONDA, etc. run weekly sales.  
- **IT Providers:** ASNET, AUCNET, CIS aggregate multiple auctions into remote portals.  
- Buyers monitor thousands of cars in real time.  

---

## Bidding Structure

- Most cars have **hidden reserve price**.  
- Until reserve is met, bids don’t guarantee sale.  
- **Urikiri (売切り) light on:** car will be sold to last bidder.  
- Lots may show bid results below reserve and remain unsold.  

---

## Purchase Methods

- **On-site:** Direct at auction house; lowest fees; physical inspection possible.  
- **Distant Bidding (remote/live):** Real-time online bidding from office; slightly higher fees.  
- **Absentee Bid (pre-bid):** Maximum price set in advance; system bids automatically up to your limit. Available both on-site and remotely.  

---

## Auction Types

- **Usual Auctions:**  
  Standard format, fast-paced, live bidding. Highest bidder above reserve wins.  

- **Tender Auctions (sealed bid):**  
  Buyers submit max price by deadline. Highest tender ≥ reserve wins. Often for lease/stock cars.  

---

## Auction Corners

Japanese auctions categorize inventory into **“corners”** based on type, condition, or price.  

### Examples
- **No-reserve / Zero Start (Nゼロ, MAX caps):** ¥0 start, no hidden reserve.  
- **First-time Listing (初出品):** Vehicles debuting; premium variant = better spec/condition.  
- **Regular / Dealer Stock:** Mainstream lots with standard rules.  
- **As-is / Accident / Non-runner:** Minimal prep, limited/no claims.  
- **White Corner:** Must be roadworthy, no leaks, basic checks only.  
- **Regional / Satellite:** Auction-specific streams (e.g., Nagoya E, Yokohama Fresh).  

### Quick Tips
- Price hunting → Zero/N-Zero.  
- Export-ready quality → Premium/Dealer.  
- Parts sourcing → As-is/Accident.  
- Always check corner notes: claim rules, fees, transport feasibility.  

---

## Auction Sheets

Auction sheet = vehicle “report card.”  

### Contents
- Vehicle details (make, model, year, chassis, mileage).  
- Equipment & drivetrain.  
- Exterior/interior grades.

- **4 / 3.5:** Average, typical wear.  
- **3 or below:** Rough condition.  
- **R / RA / A:** Accident/repaired.  
- **Interior Grades:** A (best) → D (worst).
