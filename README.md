## Company History
A.A.N. Japan is a Japanese company specializing in automotive recycling and export since 2013. Our story mirrors the evolution of the entire industry — from the early stages of Japan’s recycling system to global recognition.

- **2000–2005** – The foundation of the industry. Japan introduced the Automobile Recycling Act with mandatory standards for airbags, refrigerants, and batteries.
- **2006–2010** – Standards and licensed yards emerged. The future founders arrived in Japan, gained experience in used tire trading, and discovered the growing auto dismantling sector.
- **2013** – Establishment of A.A.N. Japan in Yachimata, Chiba. First milestones included securing a dismantling license and opening the initial yard.
- **2015** – Relocation to Yotsukaidō, Chiba — one of Japan’s key hubs for auto dismantling, strategically close to Tokyo, Yokohama, and Narita Airport.
- **2015–2020** – Growth period. Export of spare parts boomed. The company expanded from 2 to 50+ employees, invested in machinery and facilities, and introduced a Morita hydraulic press for scrap processing.
- **2020–2023** – Pandemic and global instability challenged the industry. Despite this, A.A.N. Japan received multiple awards and recognitions from national associations and government authorities.
- **Future** – Focus on digital transformation (ERP, Big Data, AI, Smart Yard), ESG initiatives (EV and battery recycling, green logistics), and globalization through new partnerships and international platforms.

# Auctions: How They Work

## History of Development
1950s — no true used car market; cars driven until scrap. Late 1950s trade-ins appear; brokers resell.  
**1967** — Toyota Usec runs first used car auction (dealer-to-dealer).  
**1970s** — JU unifies industry rules.  
**1980s** — USS & other corporate auctions make auctions a standalone business.  
**1990s** — Remote systems (AUCNET) enable nationwide bidding.  
**Today** — 130+ auction sites across Japan.

---

## Auction Systems
Auction groups (USS, TAA, ARAI, CAA, HONDA, etc.) run weekly sales. IT providers (ASNET, AUCNET, CIS) provide remote access, often via multi-portals aggregating many auctions into one interface.

---

## Bidding Structure
Most cars have a **hidden reserve**. Before reserve is reached, bids don’t guarantee a sale. When the **“urikiri” (売切り)** light turns on, the car **will be sold** to the last bidder.  
A lot can show a result below your max and still be **unsold** if reserve was higher.

---

## Purchase Methods
- **On-site** — direct participation; lowest fees; in-person inspection.  
- **Distant Bidding** — real-time online bidding from office; slightly higher fees.  
- **Absentee Bid (pre-bid)** — set maximum; system bids up to your limit (on-site or remote).

---

## Auction Types

### Usual Auctions
- Standard format; inspection sheets & start prices  
- Live bidding; highest above reserve wins  
- Very fast: many units close within seconds

### Tender Auctions
- “Silent / sealed bid”  
- Buyers submit maximum price offers  
- After deadline, seller/auction reviews tenders  
- Sold to highest tender meeting reserve  
- Often **lease/stock** with many photos

---

## Auction Corners
Auctions split inventory into specialized **corners** (sections) by type/condition/price policy/seller program.

**How Corners Work**
- **Cataloging & lanes** — corner name + lot range (e.g., N-Zero 00801–00832)  
- **Rules & eligibility** — first-time, premium, dealer-only, no-reserve, etc.  
- **Fee & risk profiles** — different fees/terms; accident/as-is corners = limited/no claims  
- **Data depth** — premium/dealer corners → more photos; as-is → minimal

**Common Corner Types (Examples)**
- **No-reserve / Zero start** — ゼロ売り切り / Nゼロ / 70,000 MAX / 200,000 MAX  
- **First-time listing** — 初出品 / JU初売り / 初出品プレミアム  
- **Regular / Domestic Regular / Dealer** — レギュラー / 国産レギュラー / ディーラー / SHOP  
- **As-is / Accident / Non-runner** — 現状車 / 事故現状車 / 現状・不動  
- **White** — ホワイト (no prior inspection; must be roadworthy; no leaks; essential parts present)  
- **Regional/satellite** — 名古屋E、横浜フレッシュ (logistics/lane timing)

**Quick Tips**
- Match corner to goal: **Zero/N-Zero** for price; **Premium/Dealer** for export-ready; **As-is/Accident** for parts sourcing  
- Read corner rule line (claims, reserve policy, condition)  
- Use corner caps (e.g., **200,000 MAX**) to pre-screen by budget  
- Logistics first: tall vans/trucks or island halls → confirm ferry limits/height/non-runner policy before bidding

---

## Auction Sheets
The sheet is the car’s **report card**:

- Vehicle details — maker, model, year, chassis/VIN, mileage  
- Equipment — transmission, drivetrain, fuel, options  
- Exterior/interior condition — graded on auction scale  
- Accident/repaired history — structural work noted  
- Damage map — dents/scratches/rust/repairs (symbols)  
- Inspector’s comments — odor, engine noise, mods, etc.

---

## Grading System (General)
- **5 / 6 / S** — Near new  
- **4.5** — Very clean  
- **4 / 3.5** — Average used  
- **3 or lower** — Rough  
- **R / A / RA** — Repaired (accident history)  
- **Interior:** **A** (best) → **D** (worst)

---

## Competing Bids from Our Clients
If multiple clients bid on the same car, we allocate to the **higher maximum bid**.  
This mirrors auction rules, maximizes purchase probability, ensures fairness, and avoids internal conflict.

---

## Auction Bills
- **Hammer price (car price)** — Final winning price. **Non-refundable.**  
- **Auction fee** — Varies by method/corner. **Non-refundable.**  
- **10% Consumption tax (消費税)** — Applied on auction **services**; refundable on export via VAT return if registered **課税事業者**.  
- **Recycling fee (リサイクル料)** — Fully refundable when the vehicle is **exported**; non-refundable on **dismantling**.  
- **Remaining Shaken tax (自動車税 / 車検残)** — Refunded **proportionally** to full months remaining after deregistration & plate return.  
- **Note:** Exporters manage which costs are **refundable** (export-related) vs **non-refundable** (domestic services).

---

## Auction Results
- **Sold (落札)** — sold to highest bidder  
- **Cancelled (出品取消)** — withdrawn (missing docs/false info/seller decision); **seller** pays cancellation fee  
- **Unsold (流れ)** — reserve not met  
- **Sold by Negotiations (後商談)** — post-auction window (10–60 min or until closing); processed **in order of requests** (not highest price)  
- **Reverse Negotiation (逆商談)** — seller offers to last bidder at last price (USS/JU same-day, conditions apply)  
- **One Price (一発落札 / ワンプライス)** — fixed-price, first applicant wins (often dealer stock like Gulliver / Car Seven, or previously unsold)  
- **Buyer Cancellation (落札者キャンセル)** — allowed only within strict window (**30–120 min**); high penalty (often **¥70,000–85,000+**)  
- **Seller Cancellation After Sale (売主キャンセル)** — serious breach; seller charged penalties by auction group

---

## Start Price & Desired Price
- **Start Price (スタート価格)** — where bidding begins  
- **Desired Price (希望価格)** — minimum acceptable (hidden until **urikiri**)  
- Too-low start may scare buyers; too-high reduces participation. Balanced starts attract bidding. Some choose **no desired price** (always sell) — fast but risky.

**Safe margins above start (guideline):**  
- Up to ¥50k → +¥20k  
- ¥60k–100k → +¥50k  
- ¥110k–500k → +¥100k  
- ¥600k–900k → +¥200k  
- ¥1.0–1.5M → +¥500k

---

## Cancelling a Mistaken Purchase
Most auctions allow cancellation **within 30–120 min** after purchase.  
Typical cost **¥70,000–¥85,000** (buyer fee + seller fee + penalty).  
Negotiation buys sometimes **cannot** be cancelled (or cost more). Trucks cost more. If penalty > car price, **re-auction** may be smarter.

---

## Auction Cars vs Stock Cars
- **Stock:** many photos, fixed price, faster docs — usually higher price (exporter carries risk).  
- **Auction:** near dealer cost + service commission — bigger choice, better price, fewer photos, longer docs.

---

# Land Transportation
After purchase, the car moves to a yard near the port or to our yard. **Payment deadlines** usually **5–7 days**; **pickup days** vary by group.  
Drivers need **ID**, **license**, and a carry-out ticket **“hanshitsu-ken” (搬出券)**.  
Some auctions allow pickup **within hours**; others **after payment confirmation**.

---

## Combined Ferry – Land Delivery
For vehicles purchased on remote islands or separated regions (e.g., **Hokkaido, Shikoku, Kyushu, Okinawa**), transport may be multi-modal:

**Process**
1. Inland trucking from auction site to nearest **ferry terminal**  
2. **Ferry** transport across strait/sea route  
3. Unloading at destination port → onward **inland trucking** to designated yard

**Key points**
- **Higher costs** due to multiple handling stages  
- **Longer delivery times** (ferry schedules & weather)  
- Satellite halls may show a different **auction name** than storage location — **confirm routing in advance**  
- **Non-runners** and **oil-leaking** vehicles are **not accepted** by ferry operators → require special inland-only handling or repair before shipment

---

## Cars from Satellite Auctions
Auction name may differ from actual car location (e.g., **TAA Shikoku** listed, car in **Ehime Matsuyama**). Always check real **storage location** before bidding.

---

## Cars from AUCNET
No physical yards; cars are scattered nationwide. Transport must be calculated **per unit**; **pre-inspection is not possible**. Fully virtual (Mondays). Expect extra coordination.
