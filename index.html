## Auctions: How They Work (9)

### History of Development
- **1950s:** No formal used car market — vehicles scrapped after use.  
- **1967:** Toyota Usec held the first dealer-to-dealer auction.  
- **1970s:** JU unified industry rules.  
- **1980s:** USS and other groups made auctions a standalone business.  
- **1990s:** Remote systems like AUCNET enabled nationwide bidding.  
- **Today:** Over 130 auction sites across Japan.  

---

### Auction Systems
- Operated by groups (USS, TAA, ARAI, CAA, Honda).  
- Weekly sales; IT providers (ASNET, AUCNET, CIS) provide remote access.  
- Multi-portals aggregate many auctions → thousands of cars visible at once.  

---

### Bidding Structure
- Most cars have hidden reserve price.  
- "Urikiri" light = reserve reached → vehicle sells to last bidder.  
- Unsold if bids don’t meet reserve, even if above your max.  

---

### Purchase Methods
- **On-site:** Lowest fees, in-person inspection.  
- **Distant bidding:** Real-time online bidding from office.  
- **Absentee bid:** Pre-bid system auto-bids up to max.  

---

### Auction Types
- **Usual auctions:** Standard live bidding, seconds per car.  
- **Tender auctions:** Silent/sealed bids; highest tender above reserve wins.  

---

### Auction Corners
- Auctions split inventory into "corners" by type, price, or quality.  

**Examples:**  
- Zero start / No-reserve (Nゼロ, 70k MAX, 200k MAX).  
- First-time listing (初出品).  
- Dealer / Premium Dealer.  
- As-is / Accident / Non-runner.  
- White corner (roadworthy only, no leaks).  
- Regional/satellite (e.g., Nagoya E, Yokohama Fresh).  

**Tips:**  
- Price hunters → Zero/N-Zero.  
- Export-ready quality → Premium Dealer.  
- Parts sourcing → As-is/Accident.  

---

### Auction Sheets
The “report card” of a car.  

**Contents:**  
- Vehicle details (maker, model, VIN, mileage).  
- Equipment (transmission, drivetrain, fuel, options).  
- Condition (exterior/interior grades).  
- Accident/repair history.  
- Damage map.  
- Inspector comments.  

**Grades:**  
- 5 / 6 / S → Excellent.  
- 4.5 → Very clean.  
- 4 / 3.5 → Average.  
- 3 or lower → Rough.  
- R / RA → Accident/repaired.  
- Interior: A → D.  

---

### Competing Bids from Our Clients
Policy: if multiple clients bid the same car → assign to **higher maximum bid**.  

- Maximizes winning probability.  
- Aligns with real auction rules.  
- Ensures fairness and avoids conflicts.  

---

### Auction Bills
- **Hammer price:** Winning car price.  
- **Auction fee:** Service fee, varies by method/corner.  
- **Consumption tax (10%):** Refundable on export.  
- **Recycling fee:** Refundable when exported, not on dismantling.  
- **Remaining shaken tax:** Refunded proportionally.  

---

### Auction Results
Possible statuses:  
- **Sold (落札).**  
- **Cancelled (出品取消).**  
- **Unsold (流れ).**  
- **Sold by Negotiations (後商談).**  
- **Reverse Negotiation (逆商談).**  
- **One Price (一発落札).**  
- **Buyer Cancellation (落札者キャンセル).**  
- **Seller Cancellation (売主キャンセル).**  

---

### Start Price & Desired Price
- **Start price (スタート価格):** Where bidding begins.  
- **Desired price (希望価格):** Seller’s minimum acceptable (hidden until urikiri).  

Safe bidding margins:  
- ≤ ¥50k → +¥20k.  
- ¥60k–100k → +¥50k.  
- ¥110k–500k → +¥100k.  
- ¥600k–900k → +¥200k.  
- ¥1.0–1.5M → +¥500k.  

---

### Cancelling a Mistaken Purchase
- Allowed 30–120 minutes after win (varies by auction).  
- Cost: ¥70,000–85,000+ depending on class.  
- Negotiation lots may be non-cancellable.  

---

### Auction Cars vs Stock Cars
- **Stock:** More photos, faster docs, higher price.  
- **Auction:** Lower price, larger choice, fewer photos, longer processing.  

---

### Land Transportation
- After purchase → moved to yard/port.  
- Deadlines: payment 5–7 days.  
- Pickup: driver requires ID, license, carry-out ticket (搬出券).  

---

### Combined Ferry – Land Delivery
For island/remote locations (Hokkaido, Shikoku, Kyushu, Okinawa).  

**Process:**  
1. Truck → ferry terminal.  
2. Ferry to destination port.  
3. Inland trucking → yard.  

**Key notes:**  
- Higher costs & longer times.  
- Non-runners/leaking vehicles not accepted by ferries.  

---

### Cars from Satellite Auctions
- Auction name may differ from real location (e.g., TAA Shikoku).  
- Must confirm storage location before bidding.  

---

### Cars from AUCNET
- No physical yards — cars scattered nationwide.  
- Virtual only (Mondays).  
- Transport calculated per unit.  
- Pre-inspection not possible.
