      <h2>General</h2>
      <p>Welcome to A.A.N. Japan Co., Ltd. (“AAN Japan”). These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) apply to all exports of used motor vehicles (“Vehicles”) sold by AAN Japan to customers located outside Japan (“you”). By transferring a deposit for the purchase of Vehicles, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="our-role" class="section">
      <h2>Our Role</h2>
      <p>AAN Japan specializes in sourcing, preparing, and exporting used motor vehicles from Japan. We act either as a direct seller from our stock or as an agent facilitating purchase and export of auction vehicles. All Vehicles are sold <em>as is</em>, unless otherwise stated in writing.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="deposit" class="section">
      <h2>Deposit Requirement</h2>
      <p>To begin doing business with AAN Japan, you must transfer a deposit:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bidding up to JPY 1,000,000: deposit JPY 100,000</li>
        <li>Bidding over JPY 1,000,000 and up to JPY 5,000,000: deposit JPY 300,000</li>
        <li>Bidding over JPY 10,000,000: deposit 50% of your requested bidding limit</li>
      </ul>
      <p>AAN Japan may require a higher deposit for expensive lots, special equipment, Vehicles of special purpose, or other non-standard lots. The deposit activates your account and enables sourcing/bidding.</p>
      <p>The deposit remains on hold with AAN Japan for the duration of our relationship and is not applied to each purchase. It will be credited toward the final invoice of your last Vehicle when you stop doing business with us.</p>
      <p>The deposit is refundable on request; you are responsible for all bank fees. Refunds are sent only to the original remitting bank account in your name and processed within 30 business days after a written request. If you refuse or cancel after we secured a Vehicle on your behalf, the deposit is not refundable.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sourcing" class="section">
      <h2>Vehicle Sourcing, Condition &amp; Information</h2>
      <p>Vehicles are sourced from Japanese auto auctions and/or AAN Japan stock. We may act as a direct seller or as an agent. Availability, pricing, and condition depend on actual auction/seller outcome.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All Vehicles are sold strictly <em>as is</em>, unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing.</li>
        <li>Auction grades, inspection sheets, mileage, and condition reports are for reference only; we do not guarantee accuracy of third-party reports, odometer readings, repair or accident history.</li>
        <li>Vehicles may contain wear, damage, or modifications not listed in documentation. We are not liable for discrepancies discovered after purchase, loading, or arrival.</li>
        <li>Some auctions offer paid Pre-Auction Inspection Service (typically up to 3 hours before bidding). We can arrange it upon your request; all costs are yours.</li>
        <li>Auction sheets and inspection reports are prepared by auctions or their subcontractors; we do not guarantee their accuracy or completeness.</li>
        <li>Photos, translations, and descriptions provided by AAN Japan are guidance only and not a warranty. You must review all available information before confirming a purchase and accept the recorded condition at the time of purchase.</li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for compliance with destination import requirements (year, emissions, other restrictions).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="translations" class="section">
      <h2>Auction Sheet Translations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Manual Translation:</strong> by AAN Japan staff upon your request.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic AI Translation:</strong> provided by AAN Japan staff for lots you view on authorized platforms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Manual translations must be requested in advance; if you purchase without one, you bear full responsibility for any automatic AI translation. If we cannot reach you by all available means, the bid will not be processed. We are responsible for accuracy of our manual translations. AI translations are for reference only. You must review all diagram marks/symbols; AAN Japan has no obligation to highlight them.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="prices" class="section">
      <h2>Prices &amp; Payments</h2>
      <p>All prices are in Japanese Yen (JPY) unless stated otherwise. All payments are accounted in JPY. If you pay in USD/other currency, the amount is converted using the MUFJ Bank TTB rate on the funds-received date; exchange differences and bank charges are yours. The applied rate is final.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payments by international bank transfer or another expressly approved method. You cover all bank fees.</li>
        <li>Full payment within 3 business days of purchase. Late payment may result in cancellation/resale without notice.</li>
        <li>Installments may be offered; shipment is released only after final payment is received.</li>
        <li>We may stop shipping, cancel, resell, or re-auction for late/incomplete payments; all related costs/losses are yours.</li>
        <li>All confirmed payments are final and non-refundable, except where required by law or explicitly stated otherwise.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>You select delivery in your account; we confirm it. Risk passes per the chosen rule. If you fail to provide instructions timely, we may arrange shipment at our discretion; all costs/risks are yours.</li>
        <li>We are not responsible for delays/charges caused by third parties or force majeure. You are responsible for import clearance and compliance.</li>
        <li>If the selected method is unavailable, choose an alternative or cancel; we are not liable for related losses/costs.</li>
